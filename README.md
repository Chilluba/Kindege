# Shadow Flight Crash Game

Shadow Flight is a thrilling, futuristic-themed "crash" betting game. Players place a bet and watch as a plane ascends, increasing a payout multiplier. The goal is to cash out before the pursuing "shadow" plane closes in and ends the round. It's a game of nerve, timing, and risk management.

## How to Play

The objective is simple but challenging:

1.  **Place Your Bet**: Before the round begins, enter the amount you wish to bet.
2.  **Watch the Flight**: As the plane takes off, the potential payout multiplier increases.
3.  **Beware the Shadow**: A red "shadow" plane gives chase. The closer it gets, the more it **drains** your potential payout, forcing a tough decision between cashing out safely or holding on for a higher reward.
4.  **Cash-Out to Win**: Click the "Cash Out" button at any time to lock in your winnings at the current effective multiplier.
5.  **Don't Get Caught**: If the shadow plane's flight path overtakes yours, the round "crashes," and your initial bet is lost.

## Key Features

-   **Dynamic Payout Drain**: The closer the shadow gets, the lower your effective multiplier becomes. This forces a strategic decision: cash out early for a safe win or hold on for a higher payout at greater risk.
-   **Adaptive Difficulty**: The game's AI adjusts the shadow plane's aggression based on your recent performance. The "Challenge Level" keeps the game engaging whether you're on a winning or losing streak.
-   **AI-Generated Mission Briefings**: Each round features a unique, thematic flight log generated by the **Google Gemini API**, adding flavor and immersion to the experience.
-   **Procedural Audio**: All sound effects—from the plane's engine hum and takeoff whoosh to UI sounds and the final explosion—are synthesized in real-time using the Web Audio API. This means no audio files are needed, providing a lightweight and dynamic auditory experience.
-   **Engaging Animations & Effects**: The game features smooth animations, particle effects for takeoff and near-crashes, and a satisfying "flying coin" animation when you successfully cash out.
-   **Safe Zones**: Rare "Safe Zone" rounds offer a higher chance of reaching a large multiplier, providing a thrilling opportunity for a big win.
-   **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a clean, performant, and maintainable codebase.
-   **Fully Responsive**: Enjoy a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **AI**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
-   **Audio**: Web Audio API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser.
-   A **Google Gemini API Key** (optional, for AI features). You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Environment Variable Setup (For AI Features)

This project is a client-side application that needs access to your `API_KEY` to generate mission briefings. Browser-based JavaScript cannot directly read system environment variables for security reasons. Therefore, a **build step is required** to make the key available if you want to enable this feature.

**Local Development (with Vite, Next.js, etc.):**
For local development, you would use a tool like Vite, which reads environment variables from a `.env` file and makes them available under `import.meta.env`.

**Production Build:**
Tools like Vite or Create React App replace `process.env.API_KEY` in the code with the actual key at build time. You would set your `API_KEY` in your hosting provider's "Environment Variables" settings, and the build command would embed it.

### Deployment on Static Hosting (Vercel, Railway, etc.)

This application is designed for easy deployment and will work correctly even without a build step.

-   **Without API Key (Default)**: The game is fully playable. If you deploy the project as-is to a static hosting provider, the core crash game will work perfectly. The only feature that will be disabled is the AI-generated mission briefings. You will see a warning message in the game if the API key is not configured.
-   **With API Key (Enabling AI Features)**: To enable the AI mission briefings, you must provide the `API_KEY` to the application. As explained above, this requires a **build step** using a tool like Vite or Next.js to securely embed the key from your hosting provider's environment variables into the static files. Simply setting the environment variable in your Vercel/Railway project settings is **not enough** for a static site without a build process.
