# Shadow Flight Crash Game

Shadow Flight is a thrilling, futuristic-themed "crash" betting game. Players place a bet and watch as a plane ascends, increasing a payout multiplier. The goal is to cash out before the pursuing "shadow" plane closes in and ends the round. It's a game of nerve, timing, and risk management.

## How to Play

The objective is simple but challenging:

1.  **Place Your Bet**: Before the round begins, enter the amount you wish to bet.
2.  **Watch the Flight**: As the plane takes off, the potential payout multiplier increases.
3.  **Beware the Shadow**: A red "shadow" plane gives chase. The closer it gets, the more it **drains** your potential payout, forcing a tough decision between cashing out safely or holding on for a higher reward.
4.  **Cash-Out to Win**: Click the "Cash Out" button at any time to lock in your winnings at the current effective multiplier.
5.  **Don't Get Caught**: If the shadow plane's flight path overtakes yours, the round "crashes," and your initial bet is lost.

## Key Features

-   **Dynamic Payout Drain**: The closer the shadow gets, the lower your effective multiplier becomes. This forces a strategic decision: cash out early for a safe win or hold on for a higher payout at greater risk.
-   **Adaptive Difficulty**: The game's AI adjusts the shadow plane's aggression based on your recent performance. The "Challenge Level" keeps the game engaging whether you're on a winning or losing streak.
-   **AI-Generated Mission Briefings**: Each round features a unique, thematic flight log generated by the **Google Gemini API**, adding flavor and immersion to the experience.
-   **Procedural Audio**: All sound effects—from the plane's engine hum and takeoff whoosh to UI sounds and the final explosion—are synthesized in real-time using the Web Audio API. This means no audio files are needed, providing a lightweight and dynamic auditory experience.
-   **Engaging Animations & Effects**: The game features smooth animations, particle effects for takeoff and near-crashes, and a satisfying "flying coin" animation when you successfully cash out.
-   **Safe Zones**: Rare "Safe Zone" rounds offer a higher chance of reaching a large multiplier, providing a thrilling opportunity for a big win.
-   **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a clean, performant, and maintainable codebase.
-   **Fully Responsive**: Enjoy a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **AI**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
-   **Audio**: Web Audio API

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser.
-   A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
-   Your API key must be available to the application as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

### Installation & Running

This project is a client-side application. The application expects the `API_KEY` environment variable to be available in its execution context.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/shadow-flight-game.git
    cd shadow-flight-game
    ```

2.  **Serve the files:**
    You can use a simple tool like `live-server` or Python's built-in HTTP server.

    **Using `live-server` (requires Node.js):**
    ```bash
    # Install live-server globally if you haven't already
    npm install -g live-server

    # Run from the project directory
    live-server
    ```

    **Using Python:**
    ```bash
    # For Python 3
    python3 -m http.server

    # For Python 2
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by your server (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).
